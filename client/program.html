          A significant number of disabled students in Tanzania are currently deprived of their fundamental 
          right to education, primarily due to inadequate infrastructure that fails to meet their needs. 
          Many schools, both private and public, lack essential accommodations such as accessible toilets, 
          wheelchair-friendly pathways, and other critical facilities, creating barriers that prevent disabled 
          students from fully participating in school life. As a result, these students are often excluded 
          from educational opportunities, limiting their potential and future prospects.

            ensure that disabled students can study alongside their peers in an inclusive and supportive 
            environment. Our initiative focuses on installing accessible toilets, building wheelchair-friendly 
            pathways, and making other necessary adjustments in schools across Tanzania. We believe that every 
            student, regardless of their ability, deserves the chance to learn and thrive. We kindly ask for 
            your support in promoting inclusive education in Tanzania by donating to this essential initiative. 
            Your contribution will help us create an environment where all students have equal opportunities to 
            succeed, regardless of the challenges they may face. Together, we can make a meaningful difference 
            in the lives of disabled students and contribute to a more inclusive future for all.
